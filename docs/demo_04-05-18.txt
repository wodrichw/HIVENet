7) after running interface.py we can accessit at port 5052
8) after taking pictures, we can see directory of new user in datasets/data
9) after aligning photos, we should see aligned photos in output_dir/ 
10) after runnin classify.py, we should see names.txt updated in classifiers/node_/
11) after running recognition.py we should see new users identified.
12) communication/client/assets/ should contain local pickle and names file
13) after sending files, remote nodes should have local pickle files in classifiers/node_IP/
